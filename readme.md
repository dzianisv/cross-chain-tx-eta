A script using data from all successfully completed cross-chain withdrawals obtained in the Superscan API that takes in a source chain id, destination chain id, and a combination of 2 AMBâ€™s (LayerZero, Hyperlane, and Wormhole) and returns an estimate of the time until the transaction can be processed. You may assume that a transaction can be processed after the UPDATE_HASH goes through.
